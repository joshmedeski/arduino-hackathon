# Hackathon
Just a little side project with some friends learning how to use Arduino units.

### Idea
We want to build a sensor that monitors the status of your washer/dryer and can ping you through [IFTTT](http://ifttt.com) that your load is complete.

### TODO:
- [ ] Find a wifi module
- [ ] Connect to the IFTTT API
- [ ] Find an shaker module
- [ ] Combine the modules and build out the prototype
- [ ] Test and refine code
- [ ] Build MVP (Minimum Viable Product)

## Personalizing Pins

To adjust the pin settings, create a `pins.personal.h` file in the `infrastructure` directory and overwrite any of the pins defined from `pins.h`.
